# Vending Machine Simulation

## Description
This is a simple command line simulation of a vending machine.

## Installation
To get started, you'll need to do the following:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/justinpallas/vending_machine.git`
2. Next, navigate into the project directory: `cd vending_machine`
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended): `python -m venv myenv`
4. Activate the virtual environment: `source myenv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `myenv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
5. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run the project: `python vending_machine.py`

## Usage
Here's how you can use the project:

1. First, make sure the project is installed (see Installation section above).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Activate the virtual environment (if you created one): `source myenv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `myenv\Scripts\activate` (Windows).
4. Run the project: `python vending_machine.py`.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to use the project.

## Running the tests
To run the tests, make sure you're in the project directory and that your virtual environment is activated. 
Then, simply run the following command: `pytest`

This will run all the tests from the test_vending_machine.py file and display the results in the terminal

## Conclusion
That's it! You should now be able to get the project up and running on your local machine.
